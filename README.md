# Dotfiles

Based off the homie Sean Yu. https://github.com/seansu4you87/dottie/blob/master/instal://github.com/seansu4you87/dottie 

`./install.sh` will replace your ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.vimrc, and ~/.xvimrc with those in this repo.  It will save your old files in a backup folder in case you want to recover them.
